    <h1>Why We Celebrate Mahashivaratri</h1>

        <h2>It is observed on the 14th night of the dark fortnight (Krishna Paksha) in the Hindu month of
            Phalguna, usually falling in February or March.</h2>
        <h3>Maha Shivratri is observed at night with silence, prayer, and meditation. Devotees stay awake 
            through the night, chant Shiva mantras, and perform Abhishek of the Shiva Lingam with water,milk,
            honey, and bilva leaves.
        </h3>
        <h4>Each month, on the 14th night of the waning moon, devotees observe what is called Masik Shivratri.
            It is a quiet and peaceful night when people offer prayers to Bholenath. But once a year, in the 
            month of Phalguna (February or March), one particular Shiva ratri becomes very special. This is 
            called Maha Shivratri. On this night, the celebrations become deeper, more meaningful, and more 
            powerful.</h4>
        <h5>One of the most important reasons we celebrate Maha Shivratri is to remember the Divine wedding
            of God Mahadev and Devi Parvati</h5>
